                                <p><i>Unsung Story</i> is an exciting turn-based, tactical war simulation RPG that plays across a great epoch, through individual story episodes. <b>YOU,</b> <b>the player,</b> research and explore the vast history of this conflict that nearly tore Rasfalia apart, by reliving past battles and political events.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><b>Your viewpoint into this series of intertwined history varies from battle to battle.</b> In one fight, you may command a group of knights protecting a great empire, while in another scenario you may lead a group of revolutionary soldiers, made up of commoners, who are fighting to topple the same empire!</p>
                                <p>Battles take place on a <b>3-D landscape,</b> with an <b>immersive player controlled camera,</b> while episode and scene selection is made through a detailed 3-D world map. Units that you command are profession based, and within each profession are multiple classes.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><b>Each class within a profession has certain characteristics, and you can change classes within a profession to suit your tactical needs!&nbsp;</b>The world is also rich with magical creatures that are not only foes on the battlefield, but under certain conditions can be commanded by you as well!</p>
                                <p>The character professions, replete with individual classes, provide you with deep game mechanics that you can <b>mold to your individual play style, </b>and <b>adapt to the scenario at hand. You will build your front and backlines by combing these classes into various groups or parties, based on the needs of the battlefield. </b></p>

The image below represents an example battle stage, as seen by the player, with the player’s party in blue and the opposing force in red. <b>All of the world stages will be richly modeled and detailed, with various terrains and elevations.</b></p>

                                <p>Instead of a square tile system, <b><i>Unsung Story</i> will use triangular tiles</b>, with units standing not at the center of tiles, but at the intersections. This gives units six possible directions of movement.

                                <p>What makes the sub-class different is that their special skills in battle will vary between subs. Though they will still have different character stats, they will have unique skills available to their sub-class type to use in battle. This is also key to class development because the skills a unit can learn when leveling up depend on its sub-class at the time.

                                </p>
                                <p>Essentially, the system allows you to shape a unit’s development by choosing which sub-class it is, and in turn what skills it learns, thus giving each character its own identity.</p>

                        <p></p><p>Video game development entails risk. All developers are daredevils at heart BUT we do all we can to lessen the risk. Like starting with an amazing idea, partnering with one of the greatest designers in the history of the industry, throwing in fantastic music and features, then run it all through a developer with a solid track record of performance on every major video game console… You get the idea.</p>

                        <p>But of course, delays and feature creep are key among the risks in any game development project, and we’d better be upfront about that. Believe it or not, developers wanting to add more is a major source of project creep, and that always stems from the best intentions: to bring the best game to the players. With the impassioned support of you, the players, we might indeed feel empowered to do better, add more, and continuing tinkering with an aspect until we feel it is "just right". It’s a risk we’re willing to take, though. We should also mention that the approval process for these platforms is outside of Playdek’s control and might be subject to surprises. We have all been to the rodeo before, but each time it’s uniquely exciting.</p><p></p>
