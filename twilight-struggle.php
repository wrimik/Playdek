                            <p><i>Twilight Struggle</i> inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics <i>We the People</i>&nbsp;and <i>Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage</i>. In that tradition, it is a challenging strategy game of medium complexity that presents new and different challenges with every game session. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?

                                &nbsp;</p><p><i>Twilight Struggle's</i> Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.</p><div contenteditable="false" data-id="2113243" data-edit_url="/projects/559431060/twilight-struggle-digital-edition/assets/2113243/edit" class="template asset">

                            <p>For almost 10 years since its original release in 2005, <i>Twilight Struggle</i> has been dominating the BGG charts as the best board game, best war game, and best strategy game. Winner of multiple awards such as 2005 Charles S. Roberts Best Modern Era Boardgame, 2006 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game, 2006 Golden Geek Best Wargame, and 2006 International Gamers Awards General Strategy (Two-players) to name a few. The time has come for GMT to take the next step and bring <i>Twilight Struggle</i> onto digital platforms in order to allow fans to play the game whenever, where ever, and with whoever they want! And in order to do this, we will need your help!</p><div contenteditable="false" data-id="2096458" data-edit_url="/projects/559431060/twilight-struggle-digital-edition/assets/2096458/edit" class="template asset">

                            <p>GMT is attempting to bring <i>Twilight Struggle</i> to digital platforms due to the overwhelming demand by our core fans. With this
                                Kickstarter campaign, we are able to share in this experience with you, our fans, and
                                allow you to help us make this a reality! To help us with the digital development, we have partnered with Playdek, who will be able to guide us through this process and who we feel will do <i>Twilight Struggle</i> justice with this electronic version of the game.</p><p>By moving to digital platforms, players will have more freedom playing the game than the physical board game allows. The digital version will include a game tutorial to help players understand the game fairly quickly, AI opponents to allow you to sharpen your skills, pass-and-play multiplayer, and both asynchronous and real-time online play so you always have a way to fit playing time in!</p><div contenteditable="false" data-id="2096461" data-edit_url="/projects/559431060/twilight-struggle-digital-edition/assets/2096461/edit" class="template asset">

                            <p>This Kickstarter campaign will allow us to bring our most popular game out for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. As a result this will help us get the game into as many fans hands as possible so that everyone who wants to play will be able to. We will also be able to develop the game for cross-platform play so that you and your friends don’t need the same type of device to play against one another; you each can use the device that works best for your play style. Twilight Struggle Digital Edition is planned to be completed around February 2015.</p><div contenteditable="false" data-id="2143397" data-edit_url="/projects/559431060/twilight-struggle-digital-edition/assets/2143397/edit" class="template asset">

                            <p><b>Ananda Gupta -&nbsp;Game Designer</b></p><p>Ananda Gupta designs electronic games by day and
                                board games by night. He was the lead designer on Firaxis Games'<i> XCOM: Enemy
                                    Within</i>, and a senior designer on <i>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</i>. Prior to that he worked
                                at ZeniMax Online Studios as lead systems designer on <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i>,
                                and he has shipped several other titles in the RTS and strategy genres.
                                <i>Twilight Struggle</i> is his first published board game design, although he has
                                contributed to many others as a playtester.</p><p><b>Jason Matthews -&nbsp;Game Designer</b></p><p>Jason Matthews hails from Los Angeles, and
                                became a gaming geek at 14 years old, when his father gave him a copy of <i>Axis
                                    and Allies</i> as a Christmas present. &nbsp;That launched an interest in
                                historical gaming that included both historical miniatures and wargames.
                                &nbsp;Later, that evolved into a broad based interest in gaming of all types on
                                all platforms. &nbsp;Having been Ananda's playtest partner on several GMT
                                games, and having been an active playtester and reviewer himself, the decided
                                to try their own hand at game design. &nbsp;Since both were deep admirers of
                                the card-driven game genre launched by Mark Herman, they produced a prototype
                                of a game on the Cold War that would be named <i>Twilight Struggle</i>. &nbsp;After
                                <i>Twilight Struggle</i>, Jason produced a trio of games with Christian Leonhard --
                                <i>1960: Making of the President</i>, <i>Campaign Manager 2000</i>, and <i>Founding Fathers</i>.
                                &nbsp;More recently, Jason collaborated with Ted Torgeson on <i>1989: Dawn of
                                    Freedom</i>. &nbsp;His game designs have received numerous awards including the
                                prestigious Charles S. Roberts award for <i>Twilight Struggle</i>. &nbsp;Jason is a
                                recovering lawyer and makes his living as a lobbyist in Washington, DC.
                                &nbsp;He is the father of two gaming larva who relish defeating him whenever
                                possible.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Andy Lewis - VP of GMT Games</b></p><p>Andy Lewis started wargaming in 1972 at the age of 9 when his parents bought him&nbsp;<i>D-Day</i>&nbsp;by Avalon Hill. His first wargame purchase was&nbsp;<i>Panzerblitz</i>&nbsp;from a toy store when he was visiting his grandparents in Florida. His first game convention was Origins 2 in Baltimore in 1976. His first work on the production side was as a playtester for Avalon Hill's&nbsp;<i>Attack Sub</i>&nbsp;released in 1991. Andy became involved with GMT in 1994 as a playtester after meeting and talking with Gene extensively at a game convention in LA. The first game he developed was&nbsp;<i>Saratog</i>a released by GMT in 1998. This was followed up with development of&nbsp;<i>Paths of Glory</i>&nbsp;released in 1999. Both of these projects he had pitched to Gene so he then got the role of being the main (but not only) submission person for GMT. In addition to his work with GMT, he has been a member of the Board of Directors of the World Boardgaming Championships convention for over a decade. Even though Andy is a part of a game company, he still very much considers this his hobby and enjoys playing games as often as he can. When not at a convention, most of his playing is euro-games with his family. Their current favorite is&nbsp;<i>Lords of Waterdeep</i>.</p><p><b>GMT Games</b>&nbsp;</p><p>GMT Games is now in its 24th year of creating and publishing a broad line of Wargames, Strategy games, Eurogames, and Family games.

                            <p>To help us out with this Kickstarter campaign, Ananda Gupta and Jason Matthews have come together once more to create a new expansion for <i>Twilight Struggle</i> called <i><b>Twilight Struggle: What If?</b></i>! This expansion is going to be brand new, and you will be able to receive a digital copy, a physical copy, or even both depending on your backer tier!</p><p><i>Twilight Struggle: What If?</i>&nbsp;is a new mini-expansion that lets players explore alternate starting situations for the two superpowers. What if Chiang's forces had held on in southern China? What if Churchill's Tories had won re-election in 1945? And what if the Western Allies had crossed the bridge too far, and reached Berlin first? These and other possibilities that alter the opening setup in <i>Twilight Struggle</i> are now open to players. Both seasoned veterans and new arrivals will enjoy the many new plays and dilemmas introduced here for the first time. This expansion will contain 8 cards, one set of charts and tables, and the rules on how to play with the expansion.</p><div contenteditable="false" data-id="2143398" data-edit_url="/projects/559431060/twilight-struggle-digital-edition/assets/2143398/edit" class="template asset">
